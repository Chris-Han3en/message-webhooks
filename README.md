# message-webhooks
Makes a website with a button on it, on click of the button it will send messages to the webhook entered. If someone is token logging in discord and you get the webhook. you can @everyone and send messages to annoy the person grabbing tokens forcing them to remove the webook.You can change the message send in "content".
Enjoy :)
